# The Galileo Passport Case

> Every Journey Begins Here.

![](assets/img/product-photos/final-product/hand-dyed/IMG_5229-1.jpeg)

Inspired by Galileo Galilei, one of history’s greatest visionaries, *The Galileo* passport case is more than a travel accessory—it's a tribute to the spirit of exploration and the pursuit of knowledge. Just as Galileo transformed our understanding of the cosmos, this passport case is designed to transform the way you carry your most essential travel documents.

Crafted from 100% vegetable-tanned leather, *The Galileo* balances functionality and elegance. Available in two luxurious variations:

- **Drum-dyed Cowhide**: Featuring a sleek, modern look, this variation is made from rich, drum-dyed cowhide, paired with premium Italian suede for the interior pockets.
  
- **Hand-dyed Calfskin**: For those who value a more artisanal touch, this version is crafted entirely from hand-dyed calfskin, showcasing the leather's natural grain and providing a luxurious feel inside and out.

Both versions are designed with the modern traveler in mind:

- **Four Interior Card Slots**: Perfect for keeping your essential cards—credit cards, IDs, or travel passes—easily accessible.
  
- **Dedicated Passport Pocket**: Sized to securely hold your passport, with additional room to accommodate a Field Notes notebook, making it a useful companion for jotting down thoughts and ideas while on the go.

- **Flap Pocket**: Located beneath the card slots, this pocket is designed with purpose, providing space for boarding passes, tickets, or an International Driving Permit—ensuring that all your travel documents are organized and within reach.

But *The Galileo* is more than just a case. It symbolizes the beginning of every journey. Inspired by Galileo's daring curiosity, this passport case is crafted for those who seek to explore new worlds, challenge boundaries, and embrace the spirit of discovery. As you travel, let this case serve as a reminder that exploration is not merely about the destination—it’s about the experiences, people, and moments that define the journey. Every adventure you undertake expands your horizons, just as Galileo expanded ours.

With *The Galileo* as your companion, you’re equipped to embark on a journey filled with curiosity and wonder. Every stamp and scuff that this case collects tells the story of where you've been, just as Galileo's observations marked a new era of exploration. Whether you're crossing oceans or borders, this is where your adventure starts.

Welcome to *The Galileo*, part of the Strathmere Leather Collection—a blend of timeless craftsmanship and the enduring human desire to explore.

## The Process

### First step - Make the case with drum-dyed leather and suede

Iterating several times in order to get the size just right. Third or fourth case was a charm and fit everything perfectly. Slightly larger in the hand than I originally anticipated, but the size offers a certain level of confidence that is needed while traveling.

### Second step - hand-dyed calfskin case

Once the sizing was perfected, tested, and finalized, I moved into making the case with calfskin. 

Every piece is cut and shaped by hand, the monogram, if you choose to add one, is set by hand.

![](assets/img/product-photos/final-product/hand-dyed/IMG_5186.jpeg)

The dye is also applied by hand, I use wool remnants to do this.

![](assets/img/product-photos/final-product/hand-dyed/IMG_5187.jpeg)

After the dye has dried I perform an oil conditioning treatment on each piece, this aids in the suppleness that you will experience with the final product. 

![](assets/img/product-photos/final-product/hand-dyed/IMG_5188.jpeg)

After ~24 hours have passed from the oil treatment, I apply a coat of leather balm and buff to a very rich luster. Afterwards I burnish smooth the flesh side of each interior pocket (the "underside").

![](assets/img/product-photos/final-product/hand-dyed/IMG_5207.jpeg)

Next is assembly, marrying all of the pieces together into their final form.

![](assets/img/product-photos/final-product/hand-dyed/IMG_5208.jpeg)

Then, edge work! Final shaping of the exterior edges, sand them, apply a coat of dye, let that dry, then burnish smooth by hand.

![](assets/img/product-photos/final-product/hand-dyed/IMG_5209.jpeg)

The final step involves me going over everything obsessively with a buffing cloth, the shine on this case is absolutely amazing. Enjoy!
