# The Premium {{ site.product }}

The premium {{ site.product }} is oh so amazing.

- Hand-dyed in your color choice, or left natural. Entirely up to you. Color swatch [here](https://strathmereleather.b-cdn.net/leather%20dye%20color%20options.jpg), shown below in dark brown. 
- Edges and exposed flesh sides (interior pockets) are burnished _smooth_ as chocolate pudding. 

## Hand-Dyed {{ site.product }}

The case below is dyed by hand using a wool remnant, it then goes through a conditioning treatment and then is balmed and buffed to achieve the rich luster that hopefully shows through your screen. The edges and flesh-sides of the interior pockets are burnished smooth by hand.
